# Collaboration chat manual

This page will help you get started using the disinformation campaign detection, qualification and reaction collaborative chat.

## Onboarding

### Request your organisation to be whitelisted

While the collaboration chat is in beta, we want to have a short discussion with your team to make sure all the constraints are clear. If your organisation has not been through this validation yet, please [send us an email](mailto:beryl.bogui@diplomatie.gouv.fr?subject=CollaborationChat). We will set up a time for a 30 to 45 minutes call to make sure we fully understand your context and that all the tools and community guidelines are clear.

### Create an account

Once your organisation has been whitelisted, you will be able to create an account with any email address provided by that organisation.

### Install the mobile app

This will ensure you can easily collaborate on the go and receive instant notifications for important opportunities such as reaction to qualified disinformation campaigns.

1. [Install the “Mattermost” app](https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps) on the App Store for iOS devices or the Play Store for Android devices.
2. Open the app.
3. Log in with the following information: `server` is `https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/collaborate`, `username` is the email address with which you registered, and `password` is your password.

## Best practices

### Share your analysis in real time

Each argument you make should be its own reply to the shared URL, rather than a single massive message shared at the end.

This way, we collectively avoid duplicate work and other members can help you refine the analysis while you are going further.
